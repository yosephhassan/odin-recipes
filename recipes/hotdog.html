    <h2 class="header small">Description:</h2>
    <p class="HDpara">The story of how the Coney Island hot dog got to the Midwest is pretty straightforward,<br>
         but no one really knows exactly how the wiener first came to be topped with what is basically a hot meat relish.<br>
          I have no idea how authentic this is and have never been to Detroit or even Flint. I have had Nathan's version, <br>
          which I enjoyed, but the word on the street is that it's not nearly as good as the relatives it spawned.</p>

            <li>¾ cup diced onion, divided</li>
            <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>

    <div class="Steps">
        <ol class="stepsList">
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine ground beef, water, 1/2 cup diced onion, ketchup, butter, garlic, <br>
                chili powder, salt, black pepper, cumin, celery salt, and cayenne pepper together in a pot.<br>
                 Mix with a potato masher or spatula over medium-high heat until mixture has a finely ground consistency and begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring beef mixture to a simmer, <br>
                reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally,<br>
                 until sauce thickens and reduces, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook hot dogs in boiling water until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange hot dog buns on a baking sheet.<br>
                 Cook buns in the preheated oven until soft and warm, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1 bun on a plate. Place a hot dog in the bun and top with meat sauce.<br>
                 Drizzle yellow mustard and a portion of remaining diced onion over the meat sauce.<br>
                  Repeat with remaining hot dogs.
            </li>
