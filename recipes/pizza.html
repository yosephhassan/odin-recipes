    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>If you refrain from grain, but can't go without pizza...you've got to try this version with a 1-ingredient crust made just from cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
